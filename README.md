This is the project files for bachelor thesis. It requires installing pytorch and mlagents package to be fully functional. For now, in order to be time-efficient, my custom Unity demo environment is currently
used in order to let me try inputing suitable parameters as well as making changes where necessary while looking for a suitable game. When the game is found, it will be used in this project.
