This is the project for bachelor thesis. It requires installing pytorch and mlagents package to be fully functional, so please do this before continues. My custom Unity demo environment is used, and there are 2 versions of it with different rewarding values. train.py is for training and saving network models, while test.py is for demonstrating model with epsilon 0 to ensure that the agent can move based on the model.
